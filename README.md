# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description
Assignment submission number 3 in the UOB Front-End Web Development Bootcamp. 

For this assignment, I adopted a similar layout to one that was used in one of our classroom activities. Much of the HTML was taken from Bootstrap although the footer was designed from scratch. The icons, were however taken from Bootstrap, which i then wrapped in an a tag.
